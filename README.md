# BlinkReminder
An application to remember to take a break from the screen

## Reason
I decided to make this, because I couldn't find a proper alternative to SafeEyes which is only available for Linux. The only usable Windows alternative I found was EyeLeo, but I'm not satisfied with that.

## Current features
* Displays a blocker window at regular intervals, keyboard disabled during that time
* Settings:
  * Display and interval times
  * Skippablity of short and long rests
  * No rest while a full screen app is running
* Proper MSI installer (Advanced Installer)

## Planned features
* Timer pause (the option is there but doesn't do anything currently)
* Saveable settings
* Custom quotes during breaks
* Make it look better, add window transitions :)
