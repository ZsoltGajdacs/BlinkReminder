# BlinkReminder
A simple WPF application to remember to take a break from the screen

## Reason
I decided to make this, because I couldn't find a proper alternative to SafeEyes which is only available for Linux. The only usable Windows alternative I found was EyeLeo, but I'm not satisfied with that.

## Current features
* Displays a blocker window at regular intervals, keyboard disabled during that time
* Minimal settings window for display and interval times

## Planned features
* Timer pause (the button is there but doesn't do anything currently)
* Custom quotes during breaks
