# BlinkReminder
An application to remember to take a break from the screen

## Reason
I decided to make this, because I couldn't find a proper alternative to SafeEyes which is only available for Linux. The only usable Windows replacement I found was EyeLeo, but I'm not satisfied with that.

## Feedback
If you feel like missing something important that would be truly helpful in this kind of app,  
Or if you have found a bug (of which there might be many or few),  
Then: https://github.com/ZsoltGajdacs/BlinkReminder/issues/new/choose  
Write! :)

## Current features
* Displays a blocker window at regular intervals, keyboard disabled during that time
  * Short breaks are default not skippable
  * Long breaks can be skipped by default
  * Both breaks can be disabled in settings, by giving them an interval time of zero
* If a full screen application is running breaks are not shown
* Can be paused for a certain time, or indefinitely (that is until resume is clicked, or the app restarted)
* Custom quotes for the breaks, can be added in settings
* Most things can be changed in settings (Saved in AppData/Roaming)
* Can check for update or go to bug report site (Issue opener here on GitHub) in About

## Planned features
* Statistics about usage
* Long breaks lock the machine
* Multi display support
* Home / Office mode
* Better looks
